# weather-dashboard

## Description
I created this project with the intention of being able to check the wcurrent and future weather for the city of my choice. It solves the problem of unpreparedness and planning when it come to what to wear and what to do based on the weather. I learned that I still have a lot to learn when it comes to using APIs and Bootstrap.
